WAV2LIP-GAN Lip Sync App
This repository contains a web-based application that generates lip-synced videos by synchronizing facial movements with an audio file using the WAV2LIP-GAN model. The app allows users to upload an avatar image and an audio file, processes the input through a pre-trained lip-sync model, and outputs a video with synchronized lip movements.

Features
Upload a custom audio file (WAV format) and an avatar image (JPG, PNG).
Generates lip-synced videos using the WAV2LIP-GAN model.
Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
Outputs video in MP4 format.
Error handling for missing files and dependencies.
Displays debugging information when errors occur.
Demo

Include a demo GIF or image of the app here to showcase the functionality.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your environment. You can install the required packages using requirements.txt.
Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wav2lip-gan-lipsync-app.git
cd wav2lip-gan-lipsync-app

# Install required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Pre-trained Model
Download the pre-trained WAV2LIP-GAN model from the official WAV2LIP repository.
Save the checkpoint model in the checkpoints/ directory:
Example: checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth
Usage
Running the App
Once all dependencies are installed and the model is downloaded, you can run the app locally using the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
How to Use the App
Upload an audio file (WAV format).
Upload an avatar image (PNG, JPG, or JPEG format).
Click on Generate Lip-Synced Video.
The app will process the inputs and generate a lip-synced video, which you can download.
Output
The lip-synced video is generated in the Outputs directory and displayed in the Streamlit app interface.
File Structure
bash

Requirements
The required Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Example
Here's an example command for running the WAV2LIP inference from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --checkpoint_path checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth --face input.jpg --audio input.wav --outfile Outputs/output_video.mp4
Troubleshooting
If the app fails to run, check for missing Python modules in the terminal and ensure the paths to the model checkpoint and input files are correct.
